Step 1: Create a new folder in D disk, named CODE_AMRTO, and create a subfolder named data under this folder
Step 2: Install the dependency libraries in Python 3.8 :
	pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Copy the model files of sparse quadrilateral layouts generated by the GMCG_revision.exe into the data subfolder (please refer to the paper)
	The triangular patch mesh model needs to be copied to the path D:\CODE_AMRTO\data\output_tri.
	The quadrilateral patch mesh model needs to be copied to the path D:\CODE_AMRTO\data\output_quad.
Step 4: Set the desired parameters in PYTOCAD.py
Step 5: Run PYTOCAD.py to generate the .json file and .3dm file (the source file of Rhino software) in the data subfolder.
